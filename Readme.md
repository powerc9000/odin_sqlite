# Odin Sqlite3

Pretty small implementation right now.

Will probably add more at some point.

## Building

Only tested on MacOS. Built to an archive then included in. Probably could be made a dylib but I was having path issues and didn't want to figure it out.

Windows probably just need to compile sqlite as a lib file. IDK I haven't tried it. But after that everythign should be gucci.

Have fun!
